# Cardano-Node
We are going to build a Cardano Node! 

What is Cardano?
Cardano ($ADA) is a 3rd-generation cryptocurrency (similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum, but different in many ways) that aims to be the most decentralized cryptocurrency that will benefit the world. Cryptocurrencies are all racing to bring the revolutionary technology of blockchain to the real world. A blockchain is simply a ledger (or list of transactions) that are powered by a bunch of connected computers. So the Bitcoin/Ethereum network is powered by a bunch of computers connected together.

The Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain operates as Proof-of-Work while the Cardano blockchain operates as Proof-of-Stake. 

What is Proof-of-Work? Proof-of-Work simply means that miners (aka Computers with [sold out] GPUs) WORK to solve complex problems and these complex problems validate the network and it's transactions. The miner that successfully solves the problem gets rewards with Bitcoin/Ethereum. Hence, Proof-of-WORK. This is a very energy-intensive process and will only keep increasing as demand continues to grow for cryptocurrency.

What is Proof-of-Stake? Proof-of-Stake means that validators/stakers (aka people with an X amount/stake of $ADA) can use their current X amount of $ADA to validate the network. Stakers have a choice of running their own node which connects directly to the Cardano blockchain or to "delegate" their stake/amount of $ADA to a node. Stakers then earn a reward for validating the network. Staking requires a lot less energy than Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies. 

So today, we will be building up a Cardano Node on AWS.
